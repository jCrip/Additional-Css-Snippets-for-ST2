# Emmet Css Snippets for Sublime Text 2

**Update:** [published the new snippets list](http://p233.github.com/Emmet-Css-Snippets-for-Sublime-Text-2/)

Zen Css (now has been updated to [Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io)) is a great tool to increase css workflow, but the property aliases are not easy to remeber. Therefore I turned Zen Css syntaxes into sublime text 2 snippets, so we can use Zen Css through autocomplete hints. It can work with Css, Less, Scss and Sass. I also made a few changes and added some additional snippets which you will see from below.

If you have any problems with this plugin or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to [fill an issue](https://github.com/P233/Emmet-Css-Snippets-for-Sublime-Text-2/issues).

*This repo has been updated accordingly from "Zen Css Snippets" to "Emmet Css Snippets".*
